<h1>Planet Fatness</h1>
<p>
  Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to start -
  people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy, overweight and
  depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress, those
  healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet. On their
  planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza was OK and
  jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and
  completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on different planets. The
  thing is that once I escaped.
